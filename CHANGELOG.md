# Changelog / Version History

Snapshots of Warlords between major improvements. Each version is a tagged git
commit — to see them: `git tag`, to inspect one: `git show v0.3.0`, to roll the
working tree back to one: `git checkout v0.3.0` (and `git checkout main` to
return). The autonomous improvement loop bumps the minor version and tags a new
snapshot after each major change.

## v0.3.0 — QoL pass _(2026-06-07)_
- Camera can pan past the map edges (one tile each side, HUD-height at the
  bottom) so the command bar no longer hides the bottom map rows.
- `Esc` pause menu: pauses the simulation, offers Resume/Restart, and lets you
  rebind the camera/attack-move/stop keys — saved to localStorage.

## v0.2.0 — Feature pass _(2026-06-07)_
- Cancel an unfinished building (full refund, tiles freed, workers released).
- Right-click an under-construction building to send workers to help build it.
- **Sawmill** — a wood drop-off; drop-off routing is now resource-aware.
- **Temple** tech building unlocks the **Knight** unit at the Barracks.

## v0.1.0 — Playable vertical slice _(2026-06-07)_
- Procedural tile map (grass/water/forest/rock/goldmines).
- 8-direction A* pathfinding + unit separation.
- Click/box selection, right-click context commands, attack-move.
- Resource gathering loop, building placement + construction, production queues,
  farm supply cap.
- Combat (melee + ranged, units and buildings), fog of war.
- Build-order-driven enemy AI with attack waves.
- HUD, minimap, win/loss + restart.
